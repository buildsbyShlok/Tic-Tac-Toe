## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The 3×3 grid is created using HTML and styled with CSS for a soft, neumorphic look.  
2. JavaScript tracks player turns and updates the board in real-time.  
3. After every move, the script checks for winning combinations or a draw.  
4. Once the game ends, the winner (or draw) is displayed.  
5. The **New Game** button resets the board instantly.
